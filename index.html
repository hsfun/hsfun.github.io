<p>Sometimes, it's handy to step through some compiled code, and source-level debugging won't cut it - maybe  you don't have the source, or it's in several programming languages. Most recently, <a href="http://jvns.ca/">Julia</a> pointed out a capture-the-flag site, <a href="http://zeromutarts.de/">zeromutarts</a>, which has a small reverse-engineering challenge, called 'serial'. If you sign up, you can download the binary and follow along with this post.</p>

<p>So: how do you start with something like this? The first thing I do is disassemble the binary:
<code>objdump -d serial &gt; serial.s</code>. It looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>serial:     file format elf32-i386
Disassembly of section .init:
080482f4 &lt;_init&gt;:
 80482f4:       53                      push   %ebx
 80482f5:       83 ec 08                sub    $0x8,%esp
 80482f8:       e8 b3 00 00 00          call   80483b0 &lt;__x86.get_pc_thunk.bx&gt;
....
 &lt;main&gt;:
 804847d:       55                      push   %ebp
 804847e:       89 e5                   mov    %esp,%ebp
 8048480:       83 e4 f0                and    $0xfffffff0,%esp
 8048483:       83 ec 30                sub    $0x30,%esp
 8048486:       c7 04 24 80 86 04 08    movl   $0x8048680,(%esp)
 804848d:       e8 ae fe ff ff          call   8048340 &lt;puts@plt&gt;
....
</code></pre>

<p>You can clearly see the main function (and its address, 0x0804847d), as well as a lot of other supporting code, such as _init, which come from glibc rather than the application's programmer. A typical line looks like this:
<code>804847d:       55                      push   %ebp</code>
The first field is the address, the second is how it's actually represented in the binary, and the third is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language">mnemonic</a> representation, which is more human-friendly than the raw numbers. People usually write in assembly with mnemonics. </p>

<p>So, let's load this binary into gdb:
<code>gdb serial</code>
It's handy to see what the current instruction is, so within gdb, run:
<code>display /i $pc</code>, and then set a breakpoint at main to start looking at the interesting parts, rather than all the glibc setup: <code>break main</code>, then type <code>run</code> to start the program. You'll see something like this:</p>

<pre><code>(gdb) run
Starting program: /yourpath/serial

Breakpoint 1, 0x08048480 in main ()
1: x/i $pc
=&gt; 0x8048480 &lt;main+3&gt;:  and    $0xfffffff0,%esp
</code></pre>

<p>If you've seen x86 assembly before, especially under Windows, the formatting may surprise you: objdump and gdb use <a href="http://asm.sourceforge.net/articles/linasm.html">AT&amp;T, rather than Intel, syntax</a>. The biggest difference is that an instruction like <code>mov %esp,%ebp</code> copies the contents of the register esp into ebp, rather than vice versa. If you're used to intel syntax, run <code>set disassembly-flavor intel</code> in gdb and you'll see familiar forms like <code>mov ebp, esp</code> and <code>mov DWORD PTR [esp],0x8048680</code> instead.  The rest of this document will keep using AT&amp;T syntax.</p>

<p>If you've debugged with gdb before, you probably know the 'n' and 's' commands, which execute the next line. N steps over function calls, while s steps into the. They have instruction-level equivalents, ni and si. If you want to dig into the actual assembly code for, say, malloc or printf, feel free to use si, but ni is a lot more convenient for a program like this, as it lets you ignore their implementations.</p>

<pre><code>(gdb) ni
0x08048483 in main ()
1: x/i $pc
=&gt; 0x8048483 &lt;main+6&gt;:  sub    $0x30,%esp
(gdb) ni
0x08048486 in main ()
1: x/i $pc
=&gt; 0x8048486 &lt;main+9&gt;:  movl   $0x8048680,(%esp)
</code></pre>

<p>There are a few more handy tricks.
See the value of the registers:</p>

<pre><code>(gdb) info registers
eax            0x1      1
ecx            0xffffd6d4       -10540
edx            0x804847d        134513789
ebx            0xf7fac000       -134561792
esp            0xffffd600       0xffffd600
ebp            0xffffd638       0xffffd638
esi            0x0      0
edi            0x0      0
eip            0x8048486        0x8048486 &lt;main+9&gt;
eflags         0x286    [ PF SF IF ]
cs             0x23     35
ss             0x2b     43
ds             0x2b     43
es             0x2b     43
fs             0x0      0
gs             0x63     99`
</code></pre>

<p>Break on a memory address, symbolically or numerically: <code>break *main+0x9</code> or <code>break *0x8048486</code>. This is really handy when you've figured out that that address is something interesting, and you want to run or rerun the program and up at that exact point at a gdb prompt.</p>

<p>You can also inspect the value of one particular register, change it, and inspect it again:</p>

<pre><code>(gdb) info registers eax
eax            0x3      3
(gdb) set $eax = 5
(gdb) info registers eax
eax            0x5      5
</code></pre>

<p>Have fun.</p>
